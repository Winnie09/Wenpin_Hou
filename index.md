### About


As a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), I focus on developing statistical machine learning methods to tackle the challenges in the intersection of statistics and data science (data in single-cell genomics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics), mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, and ultimately understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. I am particularly interested in developing methods for spatio-temporal patterns in single-cell and spatial genomics and epigenomics data.  
I am interested in collaborations in various aspects of cancer, immunology, infectious disease, obesity, maternal and child health, and health disparity. The outcomes are expected to lead to the development of new targeted therapy and new therapeutic medicine for various diseases that help the broad community.

Before that, as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) mentored by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) and [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), 
I received the [NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) ([1K99HG011468-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10104023), [5K99HG011468-02](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10378488)) from [NIH/NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in March 2021 (mentors: [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/), and [Dr. Andrew Feinberg](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/andrew-feinberg-1)), to develop computational methods for inferring single-cell DNA methylation and its spatial landscape.
Before that, I worked with [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) and [Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti](https://aravindachakravartilab.org/) in the [Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics](https://mbg.jhmi.edu/) on gene regulatory network inference using longitudinal transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data. 

I obtained my B.S. in [Computational Mathematics](http://math.sysu.edu.cn/) with the Academic Award for Excellent Students and the [Xu Chongqing
Award](http://edf.edaao.sysu.edu.cn/jzmx/jz03/cgzs02/index.htm) for academic excellence from [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/2012/en/index.htm) (2009-2013).
I received my Ph.D. in [Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php) with [University Postgraduate Fellowships (UPF)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) and [Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Wai-Ki Ching](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/) (2013-2017).


**I am looking for students and postdocs to work together on exciting research projects**. Welcome to contact me if your are interested.
