### About


As an Assistant Professor (tenure-track) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/biostatistics) at [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), Dr. Wenpin Hou focus on developing statistical machine learning methods to tackle the challenges at the intersection of statistics and data science (data in single-cell genomics, epigenomics and spatial transcriptomics), mathematical modeling of gene regulatory networks, and ultimately understanding gene regulatory mechanisms. She is particularly interested in developing methods for spatio-temporal patterns in single-cell and spatial genomics and epigenomics data.  She actively contributes to collaborations in ENCODE4 consortium, various aspects of cancer, immunology, infectious disease, developmental processes, obesity, maternal and child health, and health disparity.  The outcomes are expected to lead to uncovering the complex mechanisms of various diseases and biological contexts, and therefore lead to the development of targeted therapy that can benefit the broad community.

Before that, as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://www.jhsph.edu/) mentored by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) and [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), 
Dr. Hou received the [NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00)](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PA-20-188.html) ([1K99HG011468-01](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10104023), [5K99HG011468-02](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cHJfn5jyOUy-E1JZ1vBQlg/project-details/10378488)) from [NIH/NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/) in March 2021 (mentors: [Dr. Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/), [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/), and [Dr. Andrew Feinberg](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/andrew-feinberg-1)), to develop computational methods for inferring single-cell DNA methylation and its spatial landscape.
In addition, she worked with [Dr. Suchi Saria](https://suchisaria.jhu.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/) and [Dr. Aravinda Chakravarti](https://aravindachakravartilab.org/) in the [Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics](https://mbg.jhmi.edu/) on gene regulatory network inference using longitudinal transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data.  Dr. Hou received her Ph.D. in [Mathematics](https://hkumath.hku.hk/web/index.php) with [University Postgraduate Fellowships (UPF)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) and [Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS)](https://gradsch.hku.hk/gradsch/prospective-students/scholarship-funding-and-fees) from [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/) under the supervision of [Dr. Wai-Ki Ching](https://hkumath.hku.hk/~wkc/).


**I am looking for** **<span style="color: royalblue;"> students in all levels </span>**  **and**  **<span style="color: royalblue;;"> two postdocs </span>**  **to work together on exciting research projects**. Welcome to contact Dr. Hou or put her name in your application if your are interested!!
