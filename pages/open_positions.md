**Job Title**: Postdoc.

**Department**: Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University.

A postdoctoral position is available immediately in the research group of Dr. Wenpin Hou, an Assistant Professor, in the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University.  The research group develops novel computational and statistical methods for analyzing complex data types in genomics and data science, such as single-cell genomics, epigenomics, and spatial transcriptomics, with the goal of understanding gene regulation and improve human health. We are looking for candidates with a strong background in **deep learning and transformers, computational genomics, mathematical modeling of networks**, or related fields, who are interested in applying their skills to solve challenging problems in genomics and health. The successful candidate will work closely with Dr. Hou and collaborators from Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, and New York University on developing and applying cutting-edge methods to large-scale datasets from various sources, such as NIH-funded projects and a large consortium project. The candidate will have the opportunity to lead and co-author high-impact publications and present their work at prestigious conferences. The candidate will also gain valuable experience in statistical machine learning applied to single-cell genomics, multi-omics, and spatial transcriptomics, as well as mentorship on career development and grant writing (e.g., NIH K99/R00 Award).

**Availability and Renewal**: The position is available immediately and is renewable annually based on performance and funding availability. 

**Salary and Benefit**: Salary is competitive and commensurate with qualification. Benefits will be in accordance with Columbia University postdoctoral benefits.

**Required Qualifications**: Applicants should have a PhD degree or equivalent in computer science, statistics, bioinformatics, or related fields. Applicants should also have excellent programming skills (e.g., Python, R) and communication skills (both written and oral).

**How to Apply**: Please send a cover letter stating your research interests and qualifications, a CV, a representative publication, or preprint (if available), and contact information of three references to Dr. Wenpin Hou at wh2526@cumc.columbia.edu. Please use "Postdoc Application" as the email subject line.
