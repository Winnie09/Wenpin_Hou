**I am looking for students and postdoctoral fellows to work together on exciting research projects**.  
Welcome to contact me at if your are interested. 

**Students**: please contact me for more details. 

**Postdoctoral Fellows**: Postdoctoral fellowship opening to work on developing statistical machine learning methods to tackle the challenges at the intersection of statistics and data science (data in single-cell genomics, epigenomics, spatial transcriptomics, and images). The successful candidate will take a leading role in developing the aforementioned methods and applying the methods to single-cell/single-nuclei/multi-omics/spatial transcriptomics sequencing /genomics images data from collaborative projects and publicly available databases in human/mouse to study the evolution of complex diseases.  Depending on the capacities, the postdoc will have the opportunity to work on NIH-funded projects, a large consortium project, and collaborative research at Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, and New York University.  The postdoc will increase her/his methodological knowledge of statistical machine learning in genomics, and lead and co-author manuscript publications in both statistical methodology and genomics research. The postdoc will perform data analyses, and simulations, prepare manuscripts for submission to peer-reviewed journals and deliver presentations at scientific meetings. The postdoc will also be encouraged and advised to develop and write funding proposals if interested.

Candidates must have a Ph.D. in Biostatistics, Computer Science, Statistics, Computational Biology, Mathematics/Applied Mathematics, Electrical Engineering,  Genomics or Genetics, or a related field. 

Required experience: R/Python, basic Linux, and strong statistical and computational skills.  Candidates with experience in deep learning and in statistical machine learning modeling are especially welcome to apply. 

Application review will begin upon posted and will be considered until the position is filled. The position can start as soon as possible. 

*To apply*, please email the following documents to Dr. Wenpin Hou at wh2526@cumc.columbia.edu:
+ Cover letter addressing the candidate’s qualifications
+ Curriculum vitae
+ A statement of research interest
+ Contact information of at least three references

Salary is competitive and commensurate with qualification.

Benefits will be in accordance with Columbia University standard postdoctoral benefits.
